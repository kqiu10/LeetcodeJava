 * Question Description
 * There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by
 * rolling up (u), down (d), left (l) or right (r), but it won't stop rolling until hitting a
 * wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this
 * maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls on to the hole.
 *
 * Given the ball position, the hole position and the maze, find out how the ball could drop into
 * the hole by moving the shortest distance. The distance is defined by the number of empty
 * spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the hole (included). Output
 * the moving directions by using 'u', 'd', 'l' and 'r'. Since there could be several different
 * shortest ways, you should output the lexicographically smallest way. If the ball cannot reach
 * the hole, output "impossible".
 *
 * The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space.
 * You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The ball and the hole coordinates
 * are represented by row and column indexes.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
 *
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 1 1 0 0 1
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 1 0 0 1
 * 0 1 0 0 0
 *
 * Input 2: ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)
 * Input 3: hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (0, 1)
 *
 * Output: "lul"
 *
 * Explanation: There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.
 * The first way is left -> up -> left, represented by "lul".
 * The second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.
 * Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because 'l'
 * < 'u'. So the output is "lul".
