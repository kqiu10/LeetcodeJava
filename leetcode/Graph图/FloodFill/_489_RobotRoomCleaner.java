 * Question Description
 Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.

 Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.

 The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 90 degrees.

 When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it stays on the current cell.

 Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs shown below.

 interface Robot {
 // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
 // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.
 boolean move();

 // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
 // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
 void turnLeft();
 void turnRight();

 // Clean the current cell.
 void clean();
 }
 Example:

 Input:
 room = [
 [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
 [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
 [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
 [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 ],
 row = 1,
 col = 3

 Explanation:
 All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
 0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
 The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
 From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
