/**
 * Date: 9/24/20
 * Question Description
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is
 * surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You
 * may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: grid = [
 *   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 * ]
 * Output: 1
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: grid = [
 *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
 *   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
 *   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
 * ]
 * Output: 3
