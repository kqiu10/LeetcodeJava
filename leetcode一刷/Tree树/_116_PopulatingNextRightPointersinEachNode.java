/**
 * Description:
 * You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent
 * has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
 *
 * struct Tree树.Node {
 *   int val;
 *   Tree树.Node *left;
 *   Tree树.Node *right;
 *   Tree树.Node *next;
 * }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node,
 * the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * Time complexity:O();
 * Space complexity: O();
