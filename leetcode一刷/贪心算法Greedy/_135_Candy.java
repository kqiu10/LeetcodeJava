 * Date: 10/11/20
 * Question Description
 There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

 You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

 Each child must have at least one candy.
 Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 What is the minimum candies you must give?

 Example 1:

 Input: [1,0,2]
 Output: 5
 Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
 Example 2:

 Input: [1,2,2]
 Output: 4
