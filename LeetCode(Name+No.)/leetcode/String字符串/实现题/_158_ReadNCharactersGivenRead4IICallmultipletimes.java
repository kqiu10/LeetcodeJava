/**
 * Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement
 * a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.
 *
 *
 *
 * Method read4:
 *
 * The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into
 * the buffer array buf.
 *
 * The return value is the number of actual characters read.
 *
 * Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.
 *
 * Time complexity:O();
 * Space complexity: O();
 * Description: TODO
