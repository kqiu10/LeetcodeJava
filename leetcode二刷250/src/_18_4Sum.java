/**
 * Date: 2/18/21
 * Question Description:
 * Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in
 * nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives
 * the sum of target.
 *
 * Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
 * Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [], target = 0
 * Output: []
