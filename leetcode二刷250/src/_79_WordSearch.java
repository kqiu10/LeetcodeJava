/**
 * Date: 3/9/21
 * Question Description:
 * Given an m x n gird of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the
 * grid.
 *
 * The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells
 * are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
 *
 * Note: There will be some test cases with a board or a word larger than constraints to test if
 * your solution is using pruning.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
 * Output: true
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
 * Output: false
