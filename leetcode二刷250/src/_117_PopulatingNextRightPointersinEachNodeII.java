/**
 * Date: 3/21/21
 * Question Description:
 * iven a binary tree
 *
 * struct Node {
 *   int val;
 *   Node *left;
 *   Node *right;
 *   Node *next;
 * }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node,
 * the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
 * Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
 * Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next
 * pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in
 * level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
